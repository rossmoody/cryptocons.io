# Cryptocons

Cryptocons is a collection of named icon modules and utility functions making it easier to manage cryptocurreny icons in your React project. Each icon is placed on a 24x24 grid and available as two types:

1. **Logo:** Plain logomark icons
1. **Badge:** Logomark icons contained in a shape that can be configured
   with different border radiuses from square to circle.

```react-live
<Binance /> {/** Logo **/}
<BinanceBadge /> {/** Badge **/}
```

## Installation

To install the package in your project run:

```bash
yarn add cryptocons

# or

npm i cryptocons
```

## Usage

### Basic usage

Once the package is installed, importing and using icons is a pretty simple process. Import individual icon modules as named exports.

```bash
import { Binance, Coinbase } from 'cryptocons
```

Each icon is wrapped in a `forwardRef` that exposes the underlying SVG element. Any valid SVG property can be added to an icon.

```react-live
<Binance />
<Binance height="48px" width="48px" />
<Binance id="binance-id" />
```

### Changing icon size

Aside from regular SVG properties, each icon has a limited set of component properties. One of them is `size`. The size property is equivalent to setting the height and width of the SVG. The following examples are all fuctionally the same.

```react-live
<BinanceBadge size={64} />
<BinanceBadge height={64} width={64} />
<BinanceBadge size="64" />
<BinanceBadge height="64" width="64" />
<BinanceBadge size="64px" />
<BinanceBadge height="64px" width="64px" />
```

### Changing badge radius

Another component property exclusive to Badge icon types is `badgeRadius`.

Setting a `badgeRadius` will round the corners from a square to a circle depending on the number. Setting a badgeRadius on an icon that isn&apos;t a Badge will have no effect. The default radius is 8.

```react-live
<Binance size={64} badgeRadius={12} /> {/** No effect **/}
<BinanceBadge size={64} badgeRadius={4} />
<BinanceBadge size={64} badgeRadius={1} />
<BinanceBadge size={64} badgeRadius={100} />
<BinanceBadge size={64} />
```

### Higher order components

There are three available higher order components that bundle available
icons into a single component and use intellisense to autocomplete available
icons by name.

#### Cryptocon

All available icons can be referenced with the `icon` property.

```react-live
<Cryptocon icon="Binance" />
<Cryptocon icon="CardanoBadge" />
<Cryptocon icon="BitcoinBadge" />
```

#### CryptoconBadge

All available <i>Badge</i> icons can be referenced with the `icon` property.

```react-live
<CryptoconBadge icon="CardanoBadge" />
<CryptoconBadge icon="BitcoinBadge" />
```

#### CryptoconLogo

All available <i>Logo</i> icons can be referenced with the `icon` property.

```react-live
<CryptoconLogo icon="Cardano" />
<CryptoconLogo icon="Bitcoin" />
```

## Creating custom cryptocons

There are two methods for creating your own cryptocons.

### The Icon component

The Icon component renders an SVG element to create custom cryptocons on the fly. The Icon component will need supplied a `viewBox`.

```jsx
import { Icon } from 'cryptocons'

const ExampleIcon = () => (
    <Icon viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path d="M 100, 100 m -75, 0 a 75,75 0 1,0 150,0 a 75,75 0 1,0 -150,0" />
    </Icon>
)
```

### The createIcon convenience function

The `createIcon` function is a convenience wrapper allowing you to achieve the same result with less effort. The default `viewBox` is `0 0 24 24` when using the `createIcon` function.

```jsx
import { createIcon } from 'cryptocons'

const ExampleIcon = createIcon({
    path: (
        <path d="M 100, 100 m -75, 0 a 75,75 0 1,0 150,0 a 75,75 0 1,0 -150,0" />
    ),
})
```

### Accessibility

Implementing icons accessibly can be tricky but it's important. Especially if you plan on putting 400+ cryptocurrency icons on a page. Paraphrasing from [CSS Tricks on accessible SVG implementation](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/) and [other references](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svg-icons/), an icon can be implemented in 2 main ways.

#### 1. Decorative

Cryptocon icons assume decorative intent. What this means is icons have `aria-hidden="true"` and `focusable="false"` set by default. It's favorable to let assistive technology instead of the icon recognize parent elements. SVG elements with an `aria-label` are more verbose because they are announced as a group, so it's favorable to go with `aria-label` on the primary interactive parent element.

```jsx
<button onClick={navigateHome}>
    <BinanceBadge />
    Navigate home
</button>
```

```jsx
<button aria-label="Do Binance action">
    <BinanceBadge />
</button>
```

When icons are wrapped by an interactive element, whatâ€™s important is that the link has informative text. Therefore, if a component can be described by visible text, it is recommended to reference that text with an `aria-label` attribute rather than using the `title` property.

```jsx
<a href="/" aria-label="Navigate home">
    <Coinbase />
</a>
```

```jsx
<a href="/">
    Navigate home
    <Coinbase />
</a>
```

#### 2. Standalone

> This implementation is discouraged. It's best to use an IconButton instead as it contains accessible interaction states. But if you're gonna do it, do it in the following way.

Suppose the icon is being used as a standalone interactive element and isn't accompanied by a visible text label. In that case, it's best to use a combination of `role`, `aria-label`, and ensuring the icon can be discovered by assistive technology by setting `aria-hidden` to `false`.

```jsx
<Home
    onClick={navigateHome}
    role="img"
    aria-label="Navigate home"
    aria-hidden={false}
/>
```
