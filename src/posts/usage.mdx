# Cryptocons

Cryptocons is a collection of named icon modules and utility functions making it easier to manage cryptocurreny icons in your React project. Each icon is placed on a 24x24 grid and available as two types:

1. **Logo:** Plain logomark icons
1. **Badge:** Logomark icons contained in a shape that can be configured
   with different border radiuses from square to circle.

```react-live
<Binance size={100}/>
<BinanceBadge size={100} />
```

## Installation

```bash
yarn add cryptocons

# or

npm i cryptocons
```

---

## Import

Once the package is installed, importing and using icons is pretty simple. They are available as CommonJs or ES modules.

### CommonJS

```bash
const {Binacne, Coinbase} = require('cryptocons')
```

### ES Module

```bash
import { Binance, Coinbase } from 'cryptocons
```

## Usage

### Basic usage

Each icon is wrapped in a `forwardRef` that exposes the underlying SVG element as a ref. Any valid SVG properties can be added to a cryptocon.

```react-live
<Binance />
<Binance height="48px" width="48px" />
<Binance id="binance-id" />
```

### Changing icon size

Aside from regular SVG properties, each icon has access to a small set of custom properties. One of them is `size`. The size property is equivalent to setting the height and width of the SVG. The following examples are all fuctionally the same.

```react-live
<BinanceBadge size={64} />
<BinanceBadge height={64} width={64} />
<BinanceBadge size="64" />
<BinanceBadge height="64" width="64" />
<BinanceBadge size="64px" />
<BinanceBadge height="64px" width="64px" />
```

### Changing badge radius

Another component property exclusive to Badge icon types is `badgeRadius`.

Setting a `badgeRadius` will round the corners from a square to a circle depending on the number. Setting a badgeRadius on an icon that isn&apos;t a Badge will have no effect. The default radius is 8.

```react-live
<BinanceBadge size={64} badgeRadius={4} />
<BinanceBadge size={64} badgeRadius={1} />
<BinanceBadge size={64} badgeRadius={100} />
<BinanceBadge size={64} />
```

## Cryptocon Components

There are three available higher order components that bundle available
cryptocons into a single component and that can be rendered using the `icon` property.

### Cryptocon

**All** available icons can be rendered with the `icon` property.

```react-live
<Cryptocon icon="Binance" />
<Cryptocon icon="CardanoBadge" />
<Cryptocon icon="BitcoinBadge" />
```

### CryptoconBadge

Only **Badge** icons will be autocompleted with intellisense or available to render with the `icon` property.

```react-live
<CryptoconBadge icon="CardanoBadge" />
<CryptoconBadge icon="BitcoinBadge" />
<CryptoconBadge icon="EthereumBadge" />
```

### CryptoconLogo

Only **Logo** icons will be autocompleted with intellisense or available to render with the `icon` property.

```react-live
<CryptoconLogo icon="Cardano" />
<CryptoconLogo icon="Bitcoin" />
<CryptoconLogo icon="Ethereum" />
```

## Creating custom cryptocons

There are two methods for creating your own cryptocons.

### The Icon component

The Icon component renders an SVG element to create custom cryptocons on the fly. The Icon component will need supplied a `viewBox`.

```jsx
import { Icon } from 'cryptocons'

const ExampleIcon = () => (
    <Icon viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path d="M 100, 100 m -75, 0 a 75,75 0 1,0 150,0 a 75,75 0 1,0 -150,0" />
    </Icon>
)
```

### The createIcon convenience function

The `createIcon` function is a convenience wrapper around the Icon component allowing you to achieve the same result with less effort. The mandatory `viewBox` is `0 0 24 24` when using the `createIcon` function.

```jsx
import { createIcon } from 'cryptocons'

const ExampleIcon = createIcon({
    path: (
        <path d="M 100, 100 m -75, 0 a 75,75 0 1,0 150,0 a 75,75 0 1,0 -150,0" />
    ),
})
```

## Implementation

### Accessibility

Paraphrasing from [CSS Tricks on accessible SVG implementation](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/) and [other references](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svg-icons/), an icon can be implemented in 2 main ways.

#### 1. Decorative

Cryptocon icons assume decorative intent. What this means is icons have `aria-hidden="true"` and `focusable="false"` set by default. It's favorable to let assistive technology instead of the icon recognize parent elements. SVG elements with an `aria-label` are more verbose because they are announced as a group, so it's favorable to go with `aria-label` on the primary interactive parent element.

```jsx
<button onClick={navigateHome}>
    <BinanceBadge />
    Navigate home
</button>
```

```jsx
<button aria-label="Do Binance action">
    <BinanceBadge />
</button>
```

When icons are wrapped by an interactive element, whatâ€™s important is that the link has informative text. Therefore, if a component can be described by visible text, it is recommended to reference that text with an `aria-label` attribute rather than using the `title` property.

```jsx
<a href="/" aria-label="Navigate home">
    <Coinbase />
</a>
```

```jsx
<a href="/">
    Navigate home
    <Coinbase />
</a>
```

#### 2. Standalone

Suppose the icon is being used as a standalone interactive element and isn't accompanied by a visible text label. In that case, it's best to use a combination of `role`, `aria-label`, and ensuring the icon can be discovered by assistive technology by setting `aria-hidden` to `false`.

```jsx
<Home
    onClick={navigateHome}
    role="img"
    aria-label="Navigate home"
    aria-hidden={false}
/>
```
